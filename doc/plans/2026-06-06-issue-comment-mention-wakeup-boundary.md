# Issue Comment Mention Wakeup Boundary

## Problem

Issue comments currently need two different Agent-reference behaviors:

1. A board operator uses the issue comment composer to mention an agent and get
   that agent's attention.
2. A comment, transcript, copied link, or historical Markdown body references an
   agent for display/navigation only.

The failed first fix treated every structured `agent://...` Markdown link as
render-only. That prevented useless wakeup loops from rich rendering, but it
also broke the expected user journey: choosing an agent from the issue comment
composer no longer woke that agent, because the editor serializes selected
mentions as structured Markdown links.

## Decision

Keep `agent://...` as the stable entity-reference scheme, but add explicit
mention intent:

- `agent://<id>` means reference-only unless another layer explicitly treats it
  differently.
- `agent://<id>?intent=wake` means the writer selected an agent mention in an
  issue-comment surface and intends to route attention.

The server should not infer wake intent from UI styling alone. It should resolve
wake targets from structured agent links whose parsed intent is `wake`.

Agent-authored and operator-authored issue comments share the same wake syntax:
`agent://<id>?intent=wake`. Agents should use the wake intent only when they
intentionally need to wake another agent for attention or collaboration; plain
`agent://<id>` links and plain text agent names remain reference-only.

## Agent Journey Contract

Agents must know the boundary:

- A wake caused by a comment is visible through `RUDDER_WAKE_COMMENT_ID` and
  `RUDDER_WAKE_REASON=issue_comment_mentioned`.
- When an agent wakes from a mention, it must read the wake comment before doing
  work and should not assume ownership unless the comment explicitly asks for a
  handoff.
- When an agent writes a comment, only a structured wake-intent link wakes
  another agent. Reference-only links and bare names are durable coordination
  notes, not runtime wake requests.
- To request structured review, agents should use reviewer workflow commands;
  free-form comments and mentions are not review decisions.
- When an agent writes a user-openable URL in a comment or chat reply, it should
  make the URL clickable with standard Markdown syntax, for example
  `[NameSilo transfer page](https://www.namesilo.com/account_domain_manage_transfer.php)`.
  Bare URLs and code-spanned action URLs are not acceptable for operator-facing
  close-out comments because they are harder to click and scan in Rudder.

## Implementation

1. Extend shared agent mention parsing with an optional `intent` field and a
   helper for extracting only wake-intent structured agent mentions.
2. Teach the issue comment composer to serialize selected agent mentions with
   `intent=wake`.
3. Keep other reference surfaces on reference-only `agent://...` links.
4. Update comment wake resolution to use only wake-intent structured links.
5. Apply wake-intent resolution consistently in both comment-create and
   issue-update-with-comment routes for operator and agent authors.
6. Validate structured wake-intent agent IDs against the current organization
   before queuing wakeups.
7. Update bundled Rudder skill instructions, runtime operating contract prompts,
   and onboarding heartbeat notes so agents understand the new mention contract.

## Verification Plan

- Shared parser tests:
  - reference-only agent links parse as references
  - wake-intent links extract as wake mentions
- Editor tests:
  - issue comment composer inserts wake-intent agent links
  - generic Markdown reference serialization remains reference-only
- Route/service tests:
  - board-authored wake-intent mention queues the mentioned agent
  - reference-only `agent://...` does not wake
  - wake-intent `agent://...` IDs from another organization do not wake
  - agent-authored comments can wake peers with explicit wake-intent links
  - plain text agent names do not wake
  - runtime operating contract no longer teaches plain `agent://...` as wake
- Real-local validation:
  - open the local issue detail route
  - post a disposable comment using the issue comment composer mention menu
  - read back persisted comment and wakeup/run evidence from API or database
  - confirm reference-only comment does not enqueue a wakeup

## Non-Goals

- Do not introduce a separate ask-agent command or a new explicit button in
  this slice.
- Do not make mentions transfer ownership.
- Do not treat plain text agent names or reference-only `agent://<id>` links as
  wake requests.
