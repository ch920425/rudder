# Worktree-local Instances

When developing from multiple git worktrees, do not point two Rudder servers at the same embedded PostgreSQL data directory.

Instead, create a repo-local Rudder config plus an isolated instance for the worktree:

```sh
rudder worktree init
# or create the git worktree and initialize it in one step:
pnpm rudder worktree:make rudder-pr-432
```

This command:

- writes repo-local files at `.rudder/config.json` and `.rudder/.env`
- creates an isolated instance under `~/.rudder-worktrees/instances/<worktree-id>/`
- when run inside a linked git worktree, mirrors the effective git hooks into that worktree's private git dir
- picks a free app port and embedded PostgreSQL port
- by default seeds the isolated DB in `minimal` mode from the current effective Rudder instance/config (repo-local worktree config when present, otherwise the default instance) via a logical SQL snapshot

Codex-managed worktrees under `~/.codex/worktrees/<id>/<repo>` get a lighter automatic isolation path for
`pnpm dev` when no repo-local `.rudder/` config exists. The dev scripts derive a stable instance id from the
Codex worktree id and repo name, store data under `~/.rudder-worktrees`, and choose non-default server and
embedded PostgreSQL ports. Use `pnpm rudder worktree init` when you want a seeded database, explicit ports,
or the same isolation behavior for worktrees outside Codex's worktree directory.

Seed modes:

- `minimal` keeps core app state like organizations, projects, issues, comments, approvals, and auth state, preserves schema for all tables, but omits row data from heavy operational history such as heartbeat runs, wake requests, activity logs, runtime services, and agent session state
- `full` makes a full logical clone of the source instance
- `--no-seed` creates an empty isolated instance

After `worktree init`, both the server and the CLI auto-load the repo-local `.rudder/.env` when run inside that worktree, so normal commands like `pnpm dev`, `rudder doctor`, and `rudder db:backup` stay scoped to the worktree instance.

This is the recommended way to run a personal staging sandbox.
For example, a `staging` branch worktree should use its own worktree-local instance rather than introducing a new global `RUDDER_LOCAL_ENV=staging` profile.

That repo-local env also sets:

- `RUDDER_IN_WORKTREE=true`
- `RUDDER_WORKTREE_NAME=<worktree-name>`
- `RUDDER_WORKTREE_COLOR=<hex-color>`

The server/UI use those values for worktree-specific branding such as the top banner and dynamically colored favicon.

Typical staging flow:

```sh
git worktree add ../rudder-staging staging
cd ../rudder-staging
pnpm rudder worktree init
pnpm dev
```

Inside that worktree, `pnpm dev` will use the repo-local isolated instance and ports from `.rudder/config.json` instead of the shared main-checkout `dev` runtime.

Print shell exports explicitly when needed:

```sh
rudder worktree env
# or:
eval "$(rudder worktree env)"
```

`**pnpm rudder worktree:make <name> [options]**` — Create `~/NAME` as a git worktree, then initialize an isolated Rudder instance inside it. This combines `git worktree add` with `worktree init` in a single step.

`**pnpm rudder worktree env [options]**` — Print shell exports for the current worktree-local Rudder instance.


| Option                | Description                         |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `-c, --config <path>` | Path to config file                 |
| `--json`              | Print JSON instead of shell exports |


Examples:

```sh
pnpm rudder worktree env
pnpm rudder worktree env --json
eval "$(pnpm rudder worktree env)"
```

For project run workspaces, Rudder can also run a project-defined provision command after it creates or reuses an isolated git worktree. Configure this on the project's run workspace policy (`workspaceStrategy.provisionCommand`). The command runs inside the derived worktree and receives `RUDDER_WORKSPACE_*`, `RUDDER_PROJECT_ID`, `RUDDER_AGENT_ID`, and `RUDDER_ISSUE_*` environment variables so each repo can bootstrap itself however it wants. Some persisted database fields still use legacy `executionWorkspace*` names for compatibility.
