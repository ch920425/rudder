# Reviewer Routing

## ROUTING.REVIEWER.001

Behavior:

- Moving an issue to `in_review` or `blocked` with a reviewer agent queues a
  reviewer wake.
- Creating an issue directly in `in_review` with a reviewer agent queues a
  reviewer wake.
- Changing reviewer while an issue is already reviewable queues a reviewer
  wake.
- Reviewer wakes use source `review` and reason `issue_review_requested`.
- Reviewer wake context includes `role: "reviewer"` and instructions to record
  one structured reviewer decision.
- If the current actor is the reviewer agent, Rudder does not wake that same
  reviewer unless an assignee handoff to review is happening.

Invariant:

- Reviewer routing is not assignment routing.
- Reviewer work must close with a structured reviewer decision, not just a
  free-form comment.

Rationale:

- Review is a separate ownership state. Reusing assignment semantics would hide
  whether the agent is implementing or judging the work.
