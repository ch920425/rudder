# Issue Hierarchy And Comments

## ISSUE.HIERARCHY.001

Why:

- Parent and sub-issues let a large request become a reviewable tree of agent
  work without losing its original context.
- The hierarchy is part of the agent-facing context, not only a UI grouping:
  agents need to know whether they are acting on the root problem, a delegated
  slice, or a review child.

Product model:

- An issue may have one `parent_id`.
- Parent and child issues must belong to the same organization.
- An issue cannot be its own parent and cannot create a parent cycle.
- A child issue created from a parent inherits enough starting context to stay
  attached to the same work stream. When project is omitted, parent project is
  the default project context.
- Parent context is exposed as ancestors for detail, runtime, and navigation
  surfaces.

Flow:

1. A board operator or agent creates a sub-issue from an issue detail or API
   path.
2. Rudder validates organization boundary, self-parent, and cycle constraints.
3. Rudder stores the parent link and records activity/reference evidence for
   the relationship.
4. Issue detail exposes the parent breadcrumb/context and a children list.
5. Agent-facing issue context may include ancestors so the runtime can preserve
   why this sub-issue exists.

Invariants:

- Parent/child relationships never cross organization boundaries.
- A hierarchy update must not silently orphan context that the issue runtime
  depends on.
- Issue hierarchy does not override assignment, reviewer, checkout, or run
  admission rules; it supplies context for those contracts.

Evidence:

- Activity references include parent issue evidence when sub-issues are created
  or linked.
- Issue Detail shows parent context and sub-issue navigation.
- E2E coverage exercises sub-issue creation and visible hierarchy.

## ISSUE.COMMENTS.001

Why:

- Comments are the local collaboration record on an issue. They preserve human
  clarification, agent close-out, review notes, reopen intent, and directed
  attention.
- Comments are not just text: a comment can become a wake source, a reopen
  signal, review evidence, or a Messenger issue-thread entry.

Product model:

- A comment belongs to exactly one issue and organization.
- The author is either a board/user actor or an agent actor.
- Comment bodies may contain readable references such as issue, chat, document,
  or Library links; rendering belongs to collaboration contracts.
- Comment creation is issue-local evidence; wakeup eligibility belongs to
  `ROUTING.ATTENTION.001` and `ROUTING.COMMENT.WAKE.001`.

Flow:

1. Actor posts an issue comment through the issue route or UI thread.
2. Rudder writes the comment and records `issue.comment_added` activity.
3. Rudder parses directed agent mentions and explicit reopen intent.
4. Routing decides which agents, if any, should wake and with what source.
5. Issue Detail and Messenger issue-thread surfaces show the comment in the
   work timeline.

Invariants:

- Comment creation must leave durable issue evidence before any wake is relied
  on.
- Mention parsing must not silently reassign the issue.
- Reopen-via-comment is explicit state/workflow evidence, not a hidden status
  mutation.

Evidence:

- Comment thread shows the authored body and ordering.
- Wakeup requests can reference the source comment id.
- Reopen tests prove closed issues can be reactivated by an explicit comment.
