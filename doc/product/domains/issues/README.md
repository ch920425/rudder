# Issues Domain

## Owns

- Issue identity and hierarchy.
- Issue status lifecycle.
- Issue-local workflows such as create, update, reopen, checkout entry, and
  issue-visible close-out state.
- Issue-visible slots for comments, runs, reviewers, activity, and artifacts.

## Does Not Own

- Agent run or heartbeat execution semantics. See `RUN.*`.
- Assignee, reviewer, checkout, and wake eligibility rules. See `ROUTING.*`.
- Comment, Messenger, and thread semantics. Those belong to collaboration.
- Activity log audit semantics. Those belong to control-plane.
- Resource and Library eligibility. Those belong to library-and-context.

## Contract Index

- `ISSUE.STATE.001`: issue status lifecycle remains explicit and review-aware.
- `ISSUE.WORKFLOW.001`: issue mutations preserve activity, comments, and wake
  integration.
- `ISSUE.SURFACE.001`: issue surfaces expose state and linked evidence without
  reauthoring cross-domain rules.

## Cross-Domain Integrations

- `ROUTING.ASSIGNMENT.001` wakes assignees when issue assignment becomes
  actionable.
- `ROUTING.REVIEWER.001` wakes reviewers when issue state enters review.
- `RUN.ADMISSION.001` locks issue-backed execution and releases/promotes queued
  wakes after a run finishes.
