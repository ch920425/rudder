# Control Plane Domain

## Owns

- Approval records and governed action application.
- Budget hard stops, cost events, and spend rollups.
- Activity log taxonomy and audit references.
- Dashboard and run-intelligence rollups derived from underlying domain facts.

## Contract Index

- `CONTROL.APPROVALS.001`: approvals preserve governed action state and
  application evidence.
- `CONTROL.BUDGETS.001`: budget limits stop hidden autonomy and surface spend.
- `CONTROL.ACTIVITY.001`: mutating product actions leave auditable activity.
- `CONTROL.RUN.INTELLIGENCE.001`: operator intelligence surfaces summarize runs
  without replacing raw evidence.
- `CONTROL.DASHBOARD.001`: dashboard summarizes organization health from live
  domain records.
- `CONTROL.CALENDAR.001`: calendar events preserve source-object identity.
- `CONTROL.INBOX.001`: human inbox aggregates user-scoped operator attention.
