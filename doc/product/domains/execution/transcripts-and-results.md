# Transcripts And Results

## RUN.RESULT.001

Behavior:

- Run logs are written to the configured run log store and exposed through live
  log events with bounded chunk size.
- Stdout and stderr excerpts are persisted on the run.
- Adapter transcript parsing builds structured transcript entries when the
  adapter supplies a parser.
- Adapter result summary, result JSON, usage, cost, provider/model, session
  IDs, exit code, signal, log digest, and terminal error fields are persisted.
- Skill usage can be inferred from transcript evidence and appended as run
  events.
- Task sessions are updated or cleared after the run based on adapter result
  and session state.

Invariant:

- The operator must be able to inspect a run outcome without reading raw
  process logs only.
- Usage/session metadata must stay connected to the run that produced it.

Rationale:

- Rudder is a control plane. Agent execution is not trustworthy unless result,
  cost, transcript, and session evidence remain attached to the run.
