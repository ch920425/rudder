# Organizations Goals And Projects Domain

## Owns

- Organization mission and lifecycle as the top-level operating boundary.
- Goal hierarchy, status, owner, and dependency protection.
- Project identity, project-goal links, lead agent, status, and grouping of
  issues/resources/workspaces.

## Does Not Own

- Issue state and execution. See `ISSUE.*` and `RUN.*`.
- Project resources and workspace file eligibility. See `CONTEXT.*` and
  `WORKSPACE.*`.
- Dashboard metric rollups. See `CONTROL.*`.

## Contract Index

- `ORG.GOAL.001`: goals explain why work exists and preserve hierarchy.
- `ORG.PROJECT.001`: projects group goal-directed issues, resources, and
  workspaces.
- `ORG.SETTINGS.001`: settings persist instance/operator/organization behavior
  without crossing scopes.
- `ORG.ONBOARDING.001`: onboarding guides a fresh user to a real work surface.
- `ORG.PORTABILITY.001`: export/import moves organization knowledge with
  previewable, scoped mutations.
