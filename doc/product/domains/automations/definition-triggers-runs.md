# Automation Definition Triggers And Runs

## AUTOMATION.DEFINITION.001

Why:

- Automation is a repeatable agent work loop. It is not just a cron row; it
  binds intent, agent owner, project/goal/parent issue context, output mode,
  priority, and concurrency policy.

Product model:

- An automation belongs to one organization.
- It may bind to project, goal, parent issue, and assignee agent.
- It has status such as active, paused, or archived.
- Output mode is either tracked issue or chat output.
- Agent actors can manage only automations they are allowed to own.

Flow:

1. Operator or agent creates automation with prompt, owner, context, trigger,
   and output mode.
2. Server validates organization boundary, assignee, project/goal/parent issue,
   status, and permissions.
3. Automation detail shows definition, trigger, output, run history, and state.
4. Pausing stops new dispatch while preserving definition and history.

Invariants:

- Automation context must remain traceable to the org/project/goal/issue that
  justified the repeated work.
- Archived automations are historical records, not active dispatch sources.

Evidence:

- `server/src/__tests__/automations-service.test.ts` and
  `server/src/__tests__/automations-routes.test.ts` are the primary regression
  evidence for definition validation and permission boundaries.
- `tests/e2e/automations-index-layout.spec.ts` and
  `tests/e2e/automation-detail-layout.spec.ts` prove the operator surfaces show
  definition and run-history affordances.
- Known gap: this contract records product behavior; it does not replace
  automation output proof, which belongs to `AUTOMATION.OUTPUT.001`.

## AUTOMATION.TRIGGER.001

Why:

- Trigger semantics decide whether an automation should run now, catch up,
  skip, coalesce, or reject an external event. That is product behavior, not
  scheduler plumbing.

Product model:

- Supported trigger sources include schedule, manual/API, and webhook.
- Schedule triggers carry cron/timezone/next-run semantics.
- Webhooks carry public id, secret/signature/replay-window semantics when
  enabled.
- Dispatch source and idempotency key remain attached to the automation run.

Flow:

1. Trigger is created or edited on automation definition.
2. Scheduler/API/webhook evaluates source-specific eligibility.
3. Next run timestamp or webhook validation is computed.
4. Eligible trigger creates an automation run or records a skip/coalesce result.

Invariants:

- External trigger handling must be replay/idempotency aware.
- Schedule catch-up must be bounded so missed ticks do not flood agent work.

Evidence:

- `server/src/services/automations.scheduler.ts` owns schedule dispatch and
  next-run behavior.
- `server/src/__tests__/automations-service.test.ts` covers trigger and
  dispatch behavior at service level.
- Known gap: webhook security details should be expanded when webhook
  providers beyond the current implementation become first-class surfaces.

## AUTOMATION.RUN.001

Why:

- Automation run records are the durable evidence that a repeated job actually
  fired, was skipped/coalesced, created work, failed, or completed.

Product model:

- Run status includes received, running, issue-created, completed, failed,
  coalesced, skipped, or equivalent terminal states.
- Run records hold source, trigger, scheduled time, idempotency, linked issue,
  linked chat conversation, linked heartbeat run, and terminal error/result
  evidence.
- Concurrency policy decides whether active work causes coalesce, skip, or
  always-enqueue behavior.

Flow:

1. Dispatch creates an automation run with source and trigger evidence.
2. Concurrency gate checks active issue, active chat run, or active automation
   run according to policy.
3. Output routing creates an issue or chat-native run.
4. Run status updates as linked work starts and finishes.
5. Automation detail shows run history and terminal state.

Invariants:

- A skipped/coalesced automation must still leave enough evidence for operators
  to know why no new work appeared.
- Linked issue/chat/run ids are source of truth for navigating output.

Evidence:

- `server/src/__tests__/automations-e2e.test.ts` covers end-to-end run
  lifecycle through service/API behavior.
- `tests/e2e/automation-detail-layout.spec.ts` covers run-history visibility.
- Known gap: run-state recovery policy should be tightened if automation runs
  become distributed across multiple workers instead of the current server
  process path.
