# Automation Output Routing

## AUTOMATION.OUTPUT.001

Why:

- Automation output determines whether repeated work becomes durable issue work
  or a chat-native result. The two modes have different audit, attention, and
  close-out contracts.

Tracked issue flow:

1. Dispatch creates an execution issue with automation origin metadata.
2. The issue is assigned according to automation assignee/context.
3. Assignment wake routes the agent into the normal issue work loop.
4. Automation run stores `linkedIssueId`.
5. Optional notify-created-issue behavior affects only the subscribed operator
   and does not mean everyone follows/pins the issue.

Chat output flow:

1. Each real automation execution run gets its own Messenger chat conversation.
2. `automation_runs.linkedChatConversationId` is the source of truth for the
   per-run conversation.
3. Rudder writes a chat-native user/input message that represents automation
   run input, then streams or records the assistant result.
4. The chat assistant turn is linked to Agent Run semantics when a runtime is
   invoked.
5. Failed chat output leaves visible partial/fallback evidence instead of
   silently creating an empty unread thread.

Invariants:

- `chat_output` must not reuse an arbitrary existing human chat as the sink for
  every future run.
- Coalesced or skipped runs must not create empty chat conversations.
- `track_issue` output enters normal issue/review/run contracts after issue
  creation.

Evidence:

- Automation detail links to created issue or chat.
- Service tests cover tracked issue and chat-output routing.
- E2E covers ambiguity where chat input could be misread as automation
  creation.
