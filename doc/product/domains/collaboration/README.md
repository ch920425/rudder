# Collaboration Domain

## Owns

- Chat conversations, messages, attachments, rich references, and assistant
  turns.
- Messenger thread directory, unread state, custom groups, pin/archive/delete,
  and attention aggregation.
- Issue-thread presentation of comments/activity when shown in Messenger.
- External IM bridges that land in Messenger and then route agent work.

## Does Not Own

- Issue status or assignment. See `ISSUE.*` and `ROUTING.*`.
- Agent run execution. See `RUN.*`.
- Automation definition. See `AUTOMATION.*`.

## Contract Index

- `CHAT.LIFECYCLE.001`: chat is an intake/lightweight run surface with durable
  messages and references.
- `CHAT.RICH.REFERENCE.RENDERING.001`: markdown rich-reference tokens keep
  consistent labels, icon rhythm, baseline alignment, and truncation behavior
  across composers and read-only rendered markdown.
- `MESSENGER.ATTENTION.001`: Messenger aggregates chat, issue, approval, and
  run attention without becoming the source of every domain rule.
- `MESSENGER.CUSTOM.GROUPS.001`: Messenger custom groups organize chat, issue,
  approval, and synthetic attention rows while preserving each row's native
  navigation, read state, attention semantics, and pin ordering.
- `IM.FEISHU.001`: Feishu inbound/outbound integration bridges external chat
  into Rudder Messenger, issue, and run records.
